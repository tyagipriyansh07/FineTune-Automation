# FineTune-Automation: A Framework for Custom Model Fine-Tuning

## 📌 Overview
FineTune-Automation is a framework that enables users to fine-tune any available model for various tasks, automate dataset generation, and perform inference on fine-tuned models. It simplifies the fine-tuning process by integrating dataset preparation, model training, and inference into a streamlined workflow.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
```

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tyagipriyansh07/FineTune-Automation
cd FineTune-Automation
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then run:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up API Keys (For Dataset Generation)
- Obtain a **Google Generative AI API Key** and set it as an environment variable:  
  ```bash
  export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  ```

---

## 📊 Dataset Generation
Run the script to generate datasets for specific tasks:  
```bash
python dataset_gen.py
```
The script supports various tasks such as:  
- Sentiment Analysis  
- Topic Classification  
- Question Answering  
- Recipe Generation  
- Fitness Planning

## 🎯 Fine-Tuning a Model
Use the `finetune.py` script to train a model on your dataset.  
### **Example Usage:**  
```bash
python finetune.py --model_name "distilbert-base-uncased" \
                   --csv_path "dataset.csv" \
                   --text_column "text" \
                   --label_column "label" \
                   --epochs 3 \
                   --batch_size 8 \
                   --output_dir "finetuned_model"
```

---

## 📌 Model Inference
After fine-tuning, use `model.py` to make predictions:  
```bash
python model.py --model_path "finetuned_model" --text "This movie was amazing!"
```
### Example Output:
```
Text: This movie was amazing!
Predicted Label: Positive
Confidence: 0.97
```
